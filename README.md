# TM-MVC (Template Model-View-Controller)

TM-MVC is a lightweight JavaScript-based MVC framework designed to enable two-way data binding, dynamic UI updates, and event-driven programming without relying on external libraries. This project includes an example application for managing customer data, demonstrating CRUD functionality and conditional rendering.

- **Dynamic UI Updates**: Changes in the data model reflect instantly on the UI.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Includes Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for customer management.
- **Lightweight and Dependency-Free**: Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript.
